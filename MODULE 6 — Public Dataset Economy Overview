Here we go, Spencer — **MODULE 6**, crafted for the **LIVE (public) repo**, clean, investor‑ready, and safe for public release.  
This module explains the **public‑facing Dataset Economy**, one of the strongest and most defensible pillars of Vault Forge Live.

As always, this contains **no private formulas**, **no internal payout logic**, and **no sensitive mechanics** — only the public architecture.

# 🔷 MODULE 6 — Public Dataset Economy Overview (LIVE Repo)

The AI Dataset Exchange is one of the core engines of Vault Forge Live.  
It enables creators, studios, researchers, and enterprises to participate in a **protected, ethical, opt‑in dataset economy** where data is treated as a sovereign asset — not an extractive resource.

This module is designed to be **public‑facing**, **investor‑ready**, and **category‑defining**.

# 📚 **Vault Forge Live — Dataset Economy Overview**

The Dataset Economy allows creators and studios to upload, license, and monetize datasets inside a protected dual‑vault architecture.  
Every dataset becomes a **relic‑anchored asset** with transparent usage rights and creator‑controlled permissions.

Vault Forge Live earns revenue through dataset licensing, enterprise access, and relic‑based dataset artifacts.

---

## **🔹 1. Opt‑In Dataset Uploads**
Creators and studios choose what they upload and how it can be used.

- Upload datasets voluntarily  
- Set usage permissions  
- Define licensing terms  
- Retain ownership and authorship  

This ensures ethical, transparent participation.

---

## **🔹 2. Licensing & Access Rights**
Datasets can be licensed for:

- research  
- training  
- prototyping  
- enterprise integration  
- innovation challenges  

Creators choose the level of access.

---

## **🔹 3. Royalty‑Based Monetization**
When datasets are used:

- creators earn royalties  
- studios earn licensing fees  
- enterprises pay for access  
- relics track dataset lineage  

This creates a **sustainable, creator‑first data economy**.

---

## **🔹 4. Enterprise Dataset Access**
Enterprises can license datasets at scale.

- bulk dataset access  
- private dataset channels  
- governance‑level permissions  
- integration support  

This is one of the highest‑value revenue streams in the ecosystem.

---

## **🔹 5. Dataset Relics**
Every dataset can generate relics:

- dataset lineage relics  
- usage relics  
- licensing relics  
- milestone relics  

Relics provide **timestamped proof** of dataset evolution.

---

## **🔹 6. Ethical Data Governance**
Vault Forge Live enforces:

- opt‑in consent  
- transparent usage  
- creator control  
- dual‑vault protection  

This positions the platform as a **leader in ethical AI data economies**.

---

# 🧭 **Purpose of This Module**
This module is designed to:

- appear in the **public README**  
- anchor the **Dataset Economy** section of your fundraising site  
- show investors that Vault Forge Live has a **mature, ethical, creator‑first dataset economy**  
- establish **category legitimacy**  
- avoid revealing any private mechanics or internal formulas  

This is **safe**, **public**, and **strategically correct** for the LIVE repo.
