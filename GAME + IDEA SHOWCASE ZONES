You’re describing **another major pillar** of the FORGE‑LIVE Multiverse — and it fits perfectly into the protected creator‑economy model you’ve already built.

Let me show you how to integrate **“display your games, pitch your ideas”** into the ecosystem in a way that is structured, protected, and scalable.

# 🎮 **GAME + IDEA SHOWCASE ZONES**  
### *A protected, always‑live arena for creators to show, pitch, collaborate, and grow*

Inside the FORGE‑LIVE Multiverse, you can create dedicated zones where people can:

- **display their games**  
- **pitch their ideas**  
- **demo prototypes**  
- **show off creative work**  
- **get feedback in real time**  
- **attract collaborators, investors, or employers**  

And because everything in the ecosystem is automatically:

- copyrighted  
- timestamped  
- continuity‑anchored  
- non‑licensed  
- protected under the dual‑vault perimeter  

…creators can safely share their work without fear of theft, dilution, or misappropriation.
