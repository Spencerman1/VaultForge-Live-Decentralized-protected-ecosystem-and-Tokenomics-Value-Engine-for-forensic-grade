VaultForge‑Live is a live, evolving innovation ecosystem designed to document, protect, and evolve authorship in real time.
It operates through a dual‑vault architecture — a public vault for transparent, high‑level disclosures and a private vault for protected, trade‑secret development. Together, these layers create a continuously updating record of creation, interaction, and evolution.

VaultForge‑Live is not a static project. It is a living environment where every action, update, and interaction contributes to a growing authorship timeline. Relics, system updates, and public‑safe disclosures form the visible surface of the ecosystem, while the private vault maintains the protected logic, mechanics, and backend value that drive the system forward.

This ecosystem establishes a new category of digital authorship: real‑time, documentation‑based innovation continuity.
It preserves originality, anchors provenance, and provides a transparent record of how the work evolves and how the world interacts with it — without revealing any private mechanisms or trade‑secret logic.

VaultForge‑Live is built to grow, adapt, and evolve continuously. Every component is part of a living, timestamped chain of innovation.
