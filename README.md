***Disclaimer:***  
This material has been altered from its original form. The modification was detected and documented by the VaultForge‑Live continuity system, which preserves all prior states, timestamps, and authorship records. Because the system maintains immutable, time‑anchored relics of every version, any attempt to modify or overwrite the content occurs after the original continuity point and is therefore recorded as a derivative event.

The original version remains fully preserved within the continuity chain.
The alteration does not affect authorship, priority, or the integrity of the original record.

At this stage, the continuity chain is already sealed.
Any changes made after the original timestamp are automatically logged as post‑event modifications, meaning the opportunity to alter the historical record has passed. The system has already captured, hashed, and anchored the original state, making retroactive modification ineffective.
